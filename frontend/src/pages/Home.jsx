    "Smarter Vision for Smarter Machines": `IOIMACHINES delivers intelligent machine vision systems that help manufacturers detect defects, ensure product quality and improve safety — in real time, at production speed. Our solutions combine high-resolution industrial imaging, deterministic illumination, and deep learning–based computer vision models to perform 100% inline inspection of products at production speed. The system detects surface defects, geometric deviations, assembly errors, and process anomalies with high precision and repeatability. The inspection pipeline is designed for robustness and adaptability: AI models are trained on real production data, tolerate normal product variation, and continuously improve through supervised retraining. This enables reliable defect classification while minimizing false positives and false negatives compared to rule-based vision systems. IOIMACHINES platforms are built for industrial integration, supporting standard automation interfaces and seamless connectivity with PLCs, MES, and SCADA systems. Real-time decision outputs enable immediate process feedback, reject handling, and traceability, improving yield, reducing scrap, and enforcing consistent quality standards across production lines.`,
    "A Novel Approach": `Historically, machine vision vendors relied on feature detection techniques to recognize objects and find abnormal features in images of surfaces. These techniques are hardcoded. It meant that their solutions were only applicable in highly controlled environments, such as inspecting a single type of object on a production line. Machine Learning based machine vision systems are far more flexible today. A single system handles many object types. It also adapts itself to accommodate for changes in the nature of defects and variations in surface appearance. Moreover, it is deployable in a range of circumstances. IOIMACHINES invented a new method of distinguishing between normal and abnormal features in images of surfaces based on a Machine Learning approach.`,
    "HW Enabled High Performance": `The algorithm runs at extreme high speed to achieve real time inspection. Therefore, Parts of the algorithm run on a GPU in a PC platform. The most critical part runs on a dedicated HW platform developed by IOIMACHINES. We also provide the SW solution as Software-as-a-service on the cloud.`,
    "The Right Solution": `The method solves the problem of limited texture visibility on surfaces and provides invariance to large color variations and variations in appearance, patterns, orientation and scale. The solution overcomes limited surface texture and high visual variability by virtue of model training on representative production data. Rather than relying on fixed rules or handcrafted features, the inspection models learn discriminative visual representations directly from real product samples, capturing both acceptable variation and defect characteristics. Through training, the system becomes invariant to large color shifts, changes in appearance, repeating or non-repeating patterns, orientation, and scale. This learned invariance allows reliable inspection even on low-contrast, reflective, or visually inconsistent surfaces where traditional machine vision approaches break down. Multi-scale feature learning enables the separation of normal process variation from true defects, reducing false rejects while maintaining high defect detection sensitivity. As new data becomes available, models can be retrained or fine-tuned to adapt to evolving materials, suppliers, or process conditions without redesigning the inspection logic. The trained models are optimized for real-time, inline operation, providing deterministic inspection results and seamless integration into automated production environments.`,
    "Application Areas": `Our innovative method is applicable in several areas such as Texture analysis, medical image analysis and vision based defect detection on surfaces of industrial objects.  The method is self-adaptive in the sense that it adapts itself to changes in appearance of both normal and defect surfaces. The method is applicable across a wide range of vision-based inspection and analysis tasks where robustness to visual variability is critical. In texture analysis, it enables reliable detection of subtle defects, irregularities, and anomalies on surfaces with weak, repetitive, or non-uniform texture, even under changing illumination and appearance conditions. In medical image analysis, the approach supports the identification of structural abnormalities and pattern deviations in images with high natural variability, where consistent feature representation and invariance to scale and orientation are essential. Model training allows the system to adapt to different imaging modalities and acquisition conditions while preserving sensitivity to clinically relevant features. More broadly, the method is well suited for vision-based industrial applications such as automated quality inspection, defect classification, and process monitoring. Its ability to generalize across product variants and operating conditions makes it particularly effective in environments where traditional rule-based vision systems struggle due to frequent changes in materials, surface finish, or product design.`,
